## Data Descriptions
Employment counts and median wages are sourced from the BLS Occupational Employment & Wage Statistics (OEWS, 2001-2024), detailing occupation-specific data across Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). Individual-level demographic, residence, and occupation data come from the American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS, 2005-2024), which we aggregate into county-year panels to track occupational mobility. To characterize occupational skill demands, we merge in the O-NET 29.1 Skills matrix (2024), providing normalized importance and proficiency scores for 232 distinct skills across occupations.
